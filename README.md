# Krafi

A long time ago in a beach, far far away...<br>
NMA geeks joked that they should make Trafi, but better - Krafi (no offence).

And thus, this was born.<br>

Jokes aside, this tries to calculate the quickest path from a given bus stop to a target stop at a specific time.
It uses Trafi's timetable API to get real-life bus data in Lithuania. It manages to do so in around a second for 
routes in Kaunas.

## Previews
Successful runs (and many more actually, it works surprisingly well for such straight-forward approach!)

Of course it's still far away from even being usable (there is almost a direct transit for this one...)
